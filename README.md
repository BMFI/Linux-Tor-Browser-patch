Deprecated AFTER TOR 9. it worked on tor-8, but after Tor read this they fixed the security problem on tor-9

Linux-Tor-Browser-patch
In contrast, I have added the patch to the #! tor-browser or you can add it for your self.
So, you can run it as root in Linux at your own risk!

To boot, everyone is talking about the tor browser and Firefox.exe, so I hear someone say you have to visit their web site, so that is how the Hacker gains control and understands your machine and how to attack it. So, I hear Firefox does not have a fix for the problem. I also heard the backdoor worm opens up your Pycharm IDE and starts filling its own program Firefox.exe up with encrypted code. Puzzle and mystery? Someone said your antiviruse can not detect the worm or any cookies, so the worm is encrypted. I heard another say, we know the worm was loaded on in France. Many have warned antivirus software made befor 2005 is no longer effective and soon your modern antivirus sofware will not work. Whats is the backdoor? Puzzle and mystery? How do they get in through Tor? My best guess, it is not just Tor, but any automatic updates. I would advise disable all automatic updates for all browsers and any third party companies or any Technical company.So, makes the back door open to anyone good or bad and wireless attachs as well. Remember disable all automatic updates and in all browsers and trust no one. 
Some have suggested to use another browser other than Firefox and to change all your passwords. For example, use Google or Dogpile . . .
